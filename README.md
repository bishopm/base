## Installation

1. Install laravel using Composer (eg: to create a project named connexion: `laravel new connexion`)
2. Change to the project folder created and fix permissions on bootstrap and storage folders: 
```
sudo chmod -R 777 storage
sudo chmod -R 777 bootstrap
```
3. Check the Laravel installation is running properly before proceeding. 
4. Add the connexion package to composer.json by adding a repositories section and requiring the package as follows (note the minimum-stability setting is just until tymon/jwt-auth reaches v 1.0.0 - at the moment it is a RC:
```
"repositories": [
   {
     "type": "git",
     "url": "https://github.com/bishopm/connexion"
   }
],
"require": {
   ...
   "bishopm/connexion": "dev-master"
},
"minimum-stability": "RC",
```
5. Run *composer update* in the project folder, which will pull in the package and its dependencies
6. Add your database credentials to .env
7. In the project folder, run
`php artisan connexion:install`
follow the prompts to create your first admin user, and you're good to go!
