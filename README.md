`sudo chmod -R 777 storage / bootstrap`

```"repositories": [
      {
         "type": "git",
         "url": "https://github.com/bishopm/base"
      }
   ],
   "require-dev": {
      ...
      "bishopm/base": "dev-master"
    },```
4. Run *composer update* in the project folder, which will pull in the package and its dependencies
5. Add the package service provider to config/app.php (in the providers section): 
`bishopm\base\Providers\BaseServiceProvider::class,`
6. Add your database credentials to .env
7. In the project folder, run
`php artisan connexion:install`
